<p><h2>ABOUT US</h2></p>
<p>It is quite disheartening to know that about 50% of our food ends up in the landfills, costing us a whooping $165 billion annually. It is even more saddening when you realize most individuals just use and dump wastes ignoring the tremendous benefits that comes with recycling. Recycling reduces the use of natural resources, saves energy and boosts the economy,to name just a few. However, this makes no sense to many as no fast and direct benefit is involved. But what if you were offered a quick way to turn that trash to cash and also get to help the homeless by doing so? This makes perfect sense, right? Well, that is where we come in - to help you make more money and lend a hand to charity without having to step a foot out your apartment!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2>How We Help</h2></p>

<p>The process is quite simple, convenient and fast. We provide all our customers with trash bags with which they recycle plastic bottles, glass bottles as well as cans. Upon completion, we’d pay you a visit to pick them up and take to the vending machines without delay. The profit earned from these wastes would be distributed to both you and the homeless. We buy socks or food for the homeless and distribute it to them in person. So as you effortlessly enrich your pockets, you also get to invest in the lives of several others. </p>

<p>So now you know with Valify, everybody wins. The environment is protected, economy is boosted, energy is saved, the homeless are provided for, and you get to make side money - all by recycling your waste. It’s that easy!</p>
