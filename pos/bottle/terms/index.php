<p><b>Description of the Paotastik Platform</b></p>
<p>Paotastik provides resources and tools to entrepreneurs and the public. We have built the Paotastik Platform to meet the needs of the entrepreneur. The Paotastik Platform refers to the tools and services offered to Registered Users of Paotastik, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes any and all of the Content thereon and services provided by Paotastik on or in conjunction with websites wholly owned by Paotastik, including but not limited to, application program interfaces (“api’s”), storage, email, professional services, and collaboration services. Such tools and services include, but are not limited to, the offerings on the following websites: </p>
<p>Paotastik (Paotastikit.com): A web application that primarily provides services for entrepreneurs to validate their idea by meeting with selected users through the Paotastik platform in person to gain feedback for their idea/product.</p>
<p>Paotastik does not review or verify any User content, and does not and cannot guarantee that any User content is accurate or complete. In order to use the Paotastik Platform, you must use one of the supported Internet browsers. Additionally, you are required to register your User information with Paotastik. Paotastik does not provide internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with you internet connection. </p>
<p><b>Registered Users</b></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs: If you are an entrepreneur User, you may upload information about your business, including information you consider confidential and designate as confidential, and you may designate which Investors or Organizations may see that information. However, be aware that Paotastik has no control over the actions of Investors or Organizations. Also, though we take all reasonable steps in accordance with industry standards to prevent it, we cannot guarantee that the Paotastik Platform will never suffer from a software bug or a hacker attack that will allow unauthorized viewing of confidential material, or that any Investor is actually accredited. </p>
<p>Participants: If you are a participant, you may have access to an entrepreneur’s confidential information either directly or through an Organization, and should use your discretion in how you handle that information. All Organizations will be overseen by an Administrator, who will determine membership and set rules and parameters as provided on the Paotastik Platform for that Organizations.</p>
<p>General Users: Certain portions of the Paotastik Platform will be visible to Users who have not registered as entrepreneurs, Organizations, or Accredited Investors. Those Users, nevertheless, are bound by these Terms of Service. Entrepreneurs should be aware that information they provide that is not designated as confidential will be visible to all Users. See User Content discussion in User Submissions Section below.</p>
<p>Paotastik shall have no obligation to participate or assist in any way in the event of any dispute between Users.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above or anything to the contrary set forth in the Terms of Service, Paotastik shall have the absolute and unlimited rights to reject any User, to terminate the account of any User, to delete any User Content, or to publish any User Content that is not confidential, including for the purposes of marketing Paotastik and/or the Paotastik Platform.</p>
<p><b>License to Use</b></p>

We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the availability of or to discontinue any product or service; to impose conditions on any promotion; to bar any user from making any purchase; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or service.</p>
<p>You authorize Paotastik to charge your registered credit card, which is authorized and managed by WePay (https://go.wepay.com/) for all meetings paid to the Participant through the Paotastik Platform. "Charge" shall indicate either a charge or a debit, as applicable, against your payment method. Paotastik will use your assigned/registered credit card for future charges unless and until you cancel according to our cancellation terms by selecting the cancellation option on your company profile page. You represent that you have the legal right to use any payment method that you submit to us.</p>
<p>You are only required to pay the Participant for the time you both met. The payment has to be send the next day of the meeting. If Participant accepts only cash, then the payment has to be handed out at the meeting.<p>
<p>If payment is made through credit card, a refund can be requested by the Participant. Once the Participant accepts your refund request, your initial charge will be refunded to your card within 1-3 business days.<p>
<p>We may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or fulfillment of a payment.</p>
