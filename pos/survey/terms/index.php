<p>Valify provides resources and tools to entrepreneurs and the public. We have built the Valify Platform to meet the needs of the entrepreneur. The Valify Platform refers to the tools and services offered to Registered Users of Valify, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes any and all of the Content thereon and services provided by Valify on or in conjunction with websites wholly owned by Valify, including but not limited to, application program interfaces (“api’s”), storage, email, professional services, and collaboration services. Such tools and services include, but are not limited to, the offerings on the following websites: </p>
<p>Valify (valifyit.com): A web application that primarily provides services for entrepreneurs to validate their idea by meeting with selected users through the valify platform in person to gain feedback for their idea/product.</p>
<p>Valify does not review or verify any User content, and does not and cannot guarantee that any User content is accurate or complete. In order to use the Valify Platform, you must use one of the supported Internet browsers. Additionally, you are required to register your User information with Valify. Valify does not provide internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with you internet connection. </p>
<p><b>Registered Users</b></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs: If you are an entrepreneur User, you may upload information about your business, including information you consider confidential and designate as confidential, and you may designate which Investors or Organizations may see that information. However, be aware that Valify has no control over the actions of Investors or Organizations. Also, though we take all reasonable steps in accordance with industry standards to prevent it, we cannot guarantee that the Valify Platform will never suffer from a software bug or a hacker attack that will allow unauthorized viewing of confidential material, or that any Investor is actually accredited. </p>
<p>Participants: If you are a participant, you may have access to an entrepreneur’s confidential information either directly or through an Organization, and should use your discretion in how you handle that information. All Organizations will be overseen by an Administrator, who will determine membership and set rules and parameters as provided on the Valify Platform for that Organizations.</p>
<p>General Users: Certain portions of the Valify Platform will be visible to Users who have not registered as entrepreneurs, Organizations, or Accredited Investors. Those Users, nevertheless, are bound by these Terms of Service. Entrepreneurs should be aware that information they provide that is not designated as confidential will be visible to all Users. See User Content discussion in User Submissions Section below.</p>
<p>Valify shall have no obligation to participate or assist in any way in the event of any dispute between Users.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above or anything to the contrary set forth in the Terms of Service, Valify shall have the absolute and unlimited rights to reject any User, to terminate the account of any User, to delete any User Content, or to publish any User Content that is not confidential, including for the purposes of marketing Valify and/or the Valify Platform.</p>
<p><b>License to Use</b></p>
<p>Subject to the terms of these Terms of Service, which constitute the agreement between Valify and you, the User, Valify grants to you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use the Valify Platform. All right, title, and interest in and to the Valify Platform (excluding User Content) is and will remain the exclusive property of Valify and and/or its licensors. </p>


<p><b>Payments</b></p>
<p>Some of Valify's services are provided free of charge, while others are provided for a fee. The fees for each service vary. </p>
<p>All product and service fees, including availability and price, are subject to change at any time without notice. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the availability of or to discontinue any product or service; to impose conditions on any promotion; to bar any user from making any purchase; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or service.</p>

You represent that you have the legal right to use any payment method that you submit to us. There will be no refunds or credits for prior months of service, partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>
<p>All orders placed through the Valify Platform are subject to our acceptance. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order.

For this reason, the Valify Platform and all Content and services on it are provided strictly on an 'as is' basis.

<p>Valify reserves the right to change or discontinue, either temporarily or permanently, any part of the Valify Platform or any or all of its services at any time and without prior notice. You agree that neither Valify nor any of its third party service providers will be liable for any damages, including lost business opportunities, should such discontinuance occur. </p>

Valify reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Valify Platform, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Valify Platform for any commercial solicitation purposes. </p>

Please review the Privacy Policy before accepting this Agreement. </p>
<p>By registering with or using Valify, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information and the transfer of this information to the United States or other countries for processing and storage by Valify. </p>
<p>A User may elect to make certain confidential, personal or private information viewable through the Valify Platform. You may not disclose information obtained in this manner to any third parties without first obtaining permission from that User. You agree not to collect or aggregate User information accessible through the Valify Platform for commercial use or redistribution, including the targeted marketing of non-Valify services to individual Users.

<p>The Valify Platform provides entrepreneur Users the option to publish a subset of the data to non-registered Users in order to promote their presence on the Valify Platform, and to facilitate inviting the non-registered Users to join the Valify Platform to enable private collaboration.

<p>The Valify Platform also provides administrators of Organizations the option to publish a subset of the data to non-registered Users in order to promote their presence on the Valify Platform, and to facilitate inviting the non-registered Users to join the Valify Platform to enable private collaboration. This includes a profile to market themselves to entrepreneurs, which includes basic information such as the Organization’s name, location, investment preferences and portfolio companies. </p>
<p>All of the data for each respective User is exclusively entered and maintained by the user. Each User may (but does not have to) opt-in to publishing this information and always has the power to remove it from the public domain by un-publishing it. All other data entered on Valify is shared with other Users on the Valify Platform exclusively by the User's affirmative action; this data is, and always will, remain privately available only to those Users.

<p><b>User Submissions</b></p>
<p>We do not accept unsolicited suggestions and/or ideas. All inquiries, feedback, suggestions, ideas or other information any User provides to Valify concerning the Valify Platform (collectively, “Submissions”) will be treated as non-proprietary and non-confidential. By transmitting or posting any Submission, the User hereby grants Valify full ownership of the Submission as if Valify had created, developed and posted the Submission for its own purposes. Please note this is different from User Content, which is addressed below. Valify reserves the right to copy, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, publish, license, distribute, sell or assign the Submission in any way as it sees fit, including but not limited to copying in whole or in part, creating derivative works from, distributing and displaying any Submission in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, alone or as part of other works, or using the Submission within or in connection with Valify’s products or services. User also acknowledges that User Submissions will not be returned and Valify may use Submissions, and any ideas, concepts or know how contained therein, without payment of money or any other form of consideration, for any purpose including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing products. For clarification, deal documents and emails or other communications between Users are not considered Submissions; Valify claims no right, title or interest in such documents or communications.</p>
<p>If a User makes a Submission, the User represents and warrants that the User owns or otherwise control the rights to the Submission. User further represents and warrants that such Submission does not constitute or contain software viruses, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” Users may not use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead Valify as to the origin of any Submission. The User agrees to indemnify Valify for all claims arising from or in connection with any claims to any rights in any Submission or any damages arising from any Submission.<br>
<br>
<b>User Content</b></p>
<p>The Valify Platform permits the submission of content or communications submitted by Users (“User Content”) and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such User Content. </p>
<p>Valify does not and will not claim any ownership over or rights to User Content other than a license to display it on the Valify Platform as directed by the User, but User understands that whether or not such User Content is published, though Valify will seek to maintain the confidentiality of any data designated as confidential by a User, Valify does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Content.</p>
<p>User shall be solely responsible for User’s own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, User affirms, represents, and/or warrants that: (i) User owns or has the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Valify to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the Valify Platform and these Terms of Service; and (ii) User has the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the Valify Platform and these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>By submitting the User Content to the Valify Platform, User hereby grants Valify a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the Valify Platform and Valify’s (and its successor’s) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Valify Platform (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. In the event it does so, Valify will seek to maintain the confidentiality of User Content consistent with the User’s designation, but once again cannot guarantee any such confidentiality. User also grants each User of the Valify Platform a non-exclusive license to access the User Content of that User through the Valify Platform, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Valify Platform and under these Terms of Service. The foregoing license granted by User terminates once User or Valify removes or deletes any User Content from the Valify Platform.</p>
<p>User agrees that User will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless User is the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Valify all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Valify or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person.</p>
<p>Valify does not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. Valify does not knowingly permit infringement of intellectual property rights on its Valify Platform, and will remove all User Content if properly notified that such User Content infringes on another’s intellectual property rights. Valify reserves the right to remove User Content without prior notice. Valify will also terminate a User’s access to its Valify Platform, if a User is determined to be a repeat infringer. Valify also reserves the right to decide whether User Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. Valify may remove such User Content and/or terminate a User’s access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Content or other Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
<p>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
