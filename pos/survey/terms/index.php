<p><b>What is Aggregated Data, and how is it used?</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Data aggregation is a process in which information is gathered and expressed in a summary form for purposes such as statistical analysis, in order to obtain information about a particular group based on specific variables.

Circl uses aggregated data to generate accurate metrics about the early stage private equity industry.</p>
<p>Aggregated data are packaged and licensed to third parties such as governments, economic development agencies and financial institutions. Examples of aggregated data may include:</p>
<p>•    Data about the early equity space, such as number of deals in a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis at various generic stages of the funding process (e.g. new deals, in-progress deals, inactive deals, and invested deals).</p>
